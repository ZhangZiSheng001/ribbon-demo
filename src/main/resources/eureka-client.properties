###Eureka Client configuration for Sample Eureka Client

# see the README in eureka-examples to see an overview of the example set up

# note that for a purely client usage (e.g. only used to get information about other services,
# there is no need for registration. This property applies to the singleton DiscoveryClient so
# if you run a server that is both a service provider and also a service consumer,
# then don't set this property to false.
